                <p>Began secondary school journey from 2017 to 2021, stepping into the teenage phase.
                    Faced numerous challenges, particularly the need to focus on studying diligently for SPM.
                    Originally planned to sit for SPM in 2021 at the age of 17.
                    The COVID-19 pandemic caused SPM to be postponed, leading to me taking the exam at 18 years old instead.
                    Despite the disruptions, persevered through challenges and uncertainties.
                    Successfully completed secondary school with excellent SPM results!</p>

                <p>I entered the world of secondary school, the teenage phase, from 2017 to 2021. This was a time filled with challenges waiting to be faced. During these years, I had to study diligently as I was preparing for the SPM examination. Initially, the SPM for my cohort was planned for 2021, and we were supposed to sit for the exam at the age of 17. However, the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our plans, and the SPM was postponed. As a result, I ended up taking the exam at 18. As the saying goes, "We can only plan, but it is God who decides." Despite all the obstacles, challenges, and uncertainties, I successfully completed my secondary school journey with excellent SPM results!</p>
